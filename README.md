# build-flask-APIs-exercise

Work in progress.

## Description:
A python course exercise on building API endpoints within Flask.


## Automated checks

To set up automated checks:

* [Install pre-commit itself](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
* Run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

These checks will run automatically every time you run `git commit`. It looks to me like
[this is supported in PyCharm](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-82777/Git-Show-the-output-of-the-git-hook-scripts).
